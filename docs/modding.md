## Specific games

### Monster Hunter World

In order to mod Monster Hunter World, which was already modded on my PC, I just copied my `nativePc` folder from my PC to my Steam Deck:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Monster Hunter World\nativePc` -> `/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Monster Hunter World/nativePc`
